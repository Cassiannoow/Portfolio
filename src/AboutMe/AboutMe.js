                        I'm in love with programming and super excited to learn new languages, 
                        I'm currently studying at ColÃ©gio TÃ©cnico de Campinas (COTUCA), 
                        since I was a child I've been very interested in technology, 
                        I had already taken some programming courses, 
                        but I started intensively when I entered school in 2022,          
                        I am very easy to learn and I am always looking for knowledge.
